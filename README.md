# Gshell

Experimental, basic shell, built to learn and understand the Rust programming language and how a shell works

## Features

- cd support
- arguments support

## In the future

- Better error handling
- Pipes
- More built-ins

### Contributions

Being this a learning project, I don't intend to develop this as a real project and contributing in this sense is useless.
I would love to learn something new from contributions though, so feel free to submit a PR

This project was created based on the [Build your own shell using Rust](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/build-your-own-shell-rust/) tutorial,
though in future development it could differ significantly
